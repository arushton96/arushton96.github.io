## Introduction

My name is Andrew, and I am a member of team 305. This webpage is for my EGR314 Spring Semester class project.

## Project Summary

For team 305's project we are creating a line-following robot [like this one](https://pcbwayfile.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web/20/12/21/1129065663881t.gif). It will use color sensors to detect the location and curve of a line drawn in front of it, and servo motors to control the wheels of the machine. 
Currently the plan is to 3D-print a small chassis to hold the components of the car such as the PC boards, sensors, and motors. The user will be able to interface with the robot through both an LCD screen and a Wi-Fi connection.

## My contribution

My part in this project is to create a Wi-Fi connection using MQTT protocol. The connection will be used in part with the human-machine interface (HMI) to allow diagnostic control over the robot, as well as provide an output for different data from the machine, such as speed, processing time, battery life, and data from the sensors. As the project progresses and I discover more things I can do with MQTT, the scope of what my subsystem does might change, but for the time being it will act as a more user-friendly extension of the HMI system, and will use much of the data collected in that system.

## Continuation

Feel free to please peruse through my webpage to see the current progress and workflow of my part of the project. If you would like to navigate back to the group 305's team webpage you can access it [right here](https://asu-egr314-2025-s-305.github.io/). There you will find our group contributions and overall structure to our project, as well as links to the individual pages of the rest of the group.
