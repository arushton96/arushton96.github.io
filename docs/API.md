# Introduction
The MQTT subsystem is at the end of the UART daisy chain, so my main process will be to pass on the messages I receive back to the beginning of the chain. I will be using the data I receive on the WiFi server, but the MQTT communication will be outlined on a different page than this one. This page will only focus on the UART communications.
