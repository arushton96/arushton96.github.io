It will use color sensors to detect the location and curve of a line drawn in front of it, and servo motors to control the wheels of the machine.  Currently the plan is to 3D-print a small chassis to hold the components of the car such as the PC boards, sensors, and motors. The user will be able to interface with the robot through both an LCD screen and a Wi-Fi connection.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My contribution","text":"<p>My part in this project is to create a Wi-Fi connection using MQTT protocol. The connection will be used in part with the human-machine interface (HMI) to allow diagnostic control over the robot, as well as provide an output for different data from the machine, such as speed, processing time, battery life, and data from the sensors. As the project progresses and I discover more things I can do with MQTT, the scope of what my subsystem does might change, but for the time being it will act as a more user-friendly extension of the HMI system, and will use much of the data collected in that system.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#continuation","title":"Continuation","text":"<p>Feel free to please peruse through my webpage to see the current progress and workflow of my part of the project.

Over the course of development, our team determined that only one type of message\u2014live sensor values\u2014needed to be propagated through the system. While sender and receiver IDs were initially planned as key routing elements, they ultimately became redundant for most subsystems. However, the MQTT system retained full protocol enforcement, which required it to remain between the sensor and motor subsystems to ensure only valid messages were processed. To support this, I adapted the receiver ID field to track whether a message had already circulated through the full UART chain. Upon receiving a valid message, the MQTT system rewrote the receiver ID to its own and filtered out any returning messages marked this way, effectively preventing duplication without altering the message structure.</p> <p>A separate challenge arose from the high frequency of sensor messages\u2014often 5 to 10 per second\u2014which could overwhelm the system and prevent the motors from restarting once a stop condition was triggered. To manage this, I implemented a timed filter that suppressed duplicate sensor messages during a defined stop interval. After this delay, the MQTT subsystem automatically resumed motor activity and introduced a secondary lockout period to prevent premature retriggering. This approach ensured reliable operation without requiring upstream changes to the sensor logic.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"API/#message-overview","title":"Message Overview","text":"Message 1 Variable Name Sensor_Value Variable Type int8_t Min Value 100 Max Value 101 Example 0x64 &amp; 0x65 <p>As written above, the only value used in the system is the live sensor value.</p> <p>The Sender and Receiver bytes are 0x01, 0x03, 0x04, and 0x05.

This change affects how all other subsystems receive the message as well\u2014each sees the modified version with the updated receiver ID.
