It will use color sensors to detect the location and curve of a line drawn in front of it, and servo motors to control the wheels of the machine.  Currently the plan is to 3D-print a small chassis to hold the components of the car such as the PC boards, sensors, and motors. The user will be able to interface with the robot through both an LCD screen and a Wi-Fi connection.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My contribution","text":"<p>My part in this project is to create a Wi-Fi connection using MQTT protocol. The connection will be used in part with the human-machine interface (HMI) to allow diagnostic control over the robot, as well as provide an output for different data from the machine, such as speed, processing time, battery life, and data from the sensors. As the project progresses and I discover more things I can do with MQTT, the scope of what my subsystem does might change, but for the time being it will act as a more user-friendly extension of the HMI system, and will use much of the data collected in that system.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#continuation","title":"Continuation","text":"<p>Feel free to please peruse through my webpage to see the current progress and workflow of my part of the project.

The main requirements of the microcontroller for my subsystem are UART communication and WiFi capability. Any other required pins, such as GPIO pins, will be more plentifully available than I need on any board that I choose, so those were not considered in the decision. At a minimum, the subsystem requires 1 UART connection, but more would be easier to use. Both the ESP32 and PIC18 have at least one UART connection, so they both meet my requirements. The PIC does not have internal WiFi capabilities. While I can use external peripherals to supliment that, the ESP32 has the WiFi modules already built into it. The last consideration was speed. The PIC18 has an average clock speed of 40MHz, while the ESP32 has a speed of 240MHz and supports multithreading.
